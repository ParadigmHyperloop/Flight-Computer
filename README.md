# Getting Started

- Clone the repo
- Follow any instructtions on [hyperloop-common](https://github.com/ParadigmHyperloop/hyperloop-common)
- Run `setup.sh` or otherwise install boost
- Run `cmake`

# Development

Development is done entirely in C++ and must be POSIX compliant.  
The actual development environment you use is up to you and 
depends on how you ran your `cmake` (some use Xcode, some use 
vim/atom/emacs/sublime).

It is strongly recommended that you do development, or at least 
debugging in a POSIX environment.
